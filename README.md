# William_Wesp_Home_Site
This is my resume website's program, it should be hosted on williamdwesp.com

This site is integrated with aws and uses git webhooks. 

AWS will auto update my website when any push happens on github. 

AWS Technologies needed to get this site working:
  -CodeBuild
  -CodeDeploy
  -CodePipeline
  -EC2
  -S3
  -Route 53
  -IAM
  -Certificate Manager
