        <p class="lead">I am a Computer Science Student at Missouri Western State University. I Will graduate in May 2021. I have a love for learning and building on my skills. At Missouri Western, I was able to help Start an Association for Computer Machinery Chapter. I was vice president for two semesters and the president for one semester. Helped create a Missouri Western Linux Distribution and assisted in gaining the ability to deploy the distribution. I want to eventually get a graduate degree, preferably in cloud computing or application development, since they are the most intriguing to me. </p>
        <p class="lead">I gain significantly from working on real problems and have gained experience working for Buchanan County as a Full Stack Intern. Working on the issues at the County has given me more confidence and gained better problem-solving skills. </p>
        <p class="lead">I tend to enjoy exploring new technologies and keeping up with new software and hardware in my free time. I love playing video games and have been an avid gamer since I was in first grade. I always have music going, and if I don't, I tend to hum a song to myself. Having that noise helps me focus and just program.</p>
